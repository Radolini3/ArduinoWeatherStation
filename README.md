# ArduinoWeatherStation

This repository was an small project made on Arduino Uno microcontoller that features LCD 2x16 display (no i2c module), BMP280 temperature and pressure sensor with RTC DS1307 clock.

Main features of the project:<br />
  - Displaying current temperature and air pressure every 1 second
  - Displaying current date and time 
  - By the push of the button you can switch LCD information shown from temperature/pressure to time/date 

I designed a simple PCB on which I placed the components of the station 
The PCB comes with DC jack port which you can connect 5V power supply, although connecting the micro usb to Arduino would be as good as this option. 
Added potentiometer to adjust LCD contrast.
